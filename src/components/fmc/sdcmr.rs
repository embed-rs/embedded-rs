//! SDRAM Command Mode register (FMC_SDCMR)
//!
//! This register contains the command issued when the SDRAM device is accessed. This register is
//! used to initialize the SDRAM device, and to activate the Self-refresh and the Power-down modes.
//! As soon as the MODE field is written, the command will be issued only to one or to both SDRAM
//! banks according to CTB1 and CTB2 command bits. This register is the same for both SDRAM banks.
